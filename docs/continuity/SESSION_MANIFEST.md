**Manifest version:** 4  
**Updated:** 2026-07-26  
**Branch:** `agent/rowdy-room-continuity`  
**Authority checkpoint commit:** `e5ac4b73078cf8135fb3c2e4d179af35211fd22f`

Use this compact file for ordinary continuations in a verified session. If the manifest version and applicable authority versions match the session state, do not reload unchanged full documents. Load only new mission events and task-relevant records.

Force a full applicable reload for a new session, compaction, reconstruction, contradiction, missing authority, manifest change, or material/high-risk work.

## Compact compliance checklist

- Use the latest explicit correction.
- Confirm the action is authorized and proportional.
- Load only task-relevant changed records.
- Verify attempted actions by readback.
- Preserve privacy and approval gates.
- Mark missing or contradictory authority `Recovery required`.
- Use the full final Law audit when the work is material, mutating, high-risk, contradictory, reconstructed, or manifest-changed.

## Approved coordination defaults

- Deterministic code handles routing, status, locks, leases, heartbeat, queue polling, and idle decisions.
- Models exchange compact mission packets and delta events.
- Complete durable history stays outside the active prompt until needed.
- One primary worker is the default.
- Cloud ChatGPT and Work sessions are not treated as self-waking without a verified trigger or adapter.
